# Project Overview

This Python notebook uses reviews of Austin bars gathered from Google to generate recommendations for users based on their input about what type of bar they want to visit. This is accomplished by applying word embeddings to user input and the bar reviews. The bars are ranked based on a combination of their average sentiment score and their average similarity score to user input. Using word embeddings allows users to ask for a bar recommendation in a more conversational manner.
